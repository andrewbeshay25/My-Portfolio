# Andrew Beshay – Developer Portfolio 🚀

This is my interactive personal portfolio, crafted to showcase not just my technical projects, but also my story, my mission, and my unique brand as a developer who builds for impact. The site was designed using the **Hero archetype** and incorporates principles of **persuasion** to guide visitors through who I am and what I do.
